# promises-exercises

A set of exercises to learn about asynchronous programming using Promises in JavaScript.

Fill in the blanks to make all the tests green.

Adapted from [this repository](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/promises-exercises) by Lighthouse Labs.

## Setup

0. Verify that `node --version` returns at least `v19.0.0` or later. If not, install a recent version of node.js per the standard [installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to download the Node modules.

Don't want to install anything on your machine? You can edit and run all the code in a browser using replit. Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com/), sign up, create a new REPL, select 'Import from GitHub', fill in this repository's URL and choose 'Node.js' as the template. Then run `npm install` in the provided shell.

## Using

For these exercises, there are a few folders, each corresponding to a step in the lesson. Each of them has a `README.md`, a `test.js`, and an `answers.js`.  Read the `README.md` for further instructions, implement the methods in the `answers.js`, passing the tests in the `tests.js` file.

You are free to look at any of the tests for guidance, but don't change them.

> To run the tests of the exercises in a directory like `01-making-promises`, execute `npm run 01-making-promises` from the top-level project directory.

## Outline

* `npm run 01-making-promises` - Create promises with Promise.resolve, Promise.reject, and the Promise constructor.
* `npm run 02-consuming-promises` - Use `.then(cb)` and `.catch(cb)` to respond to a promise completing and do something with the result.
* `npm run 03-transforming-promises` - Use `.then(cb)` and `.catch(cb)` to transform the results of async processes.
* `npm run 04-chaining-promises` - Use `.then(cb)` and `.catch(cb)` to chain async processes.
* `npm run 05-callbacks` - Turn callback-centric functions into promise-centric functions.
* `npm run 06-async-functions` - Turn promise-centric functions into `async` functions. Refactor code that uses `.then(cb)` to use sequential control flow instead.

> Tip:  To run any of the exercises above in watch mode, add `-- --watch`, (e.g. `npm run 01-making-promises -- --watch`)
